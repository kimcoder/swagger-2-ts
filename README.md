# Swagger 2 TS (Swagger to TypeScript)

**Swagger 2 TS** is a Chrome extension that reads API documentation based on Swagger 2.0 and OpenAPI 3.x and converts it into TypeScript code. It helps developers quickly convert API documentation into TypeScript interfaces and API functions.

By automating the process of converting API documentation to TypeScript code, it greatly improves development productivity. You can select API endpoints directly from Swagger UI or OpenAPI pages and instantly generate TypeScript code in your preferred style.

## Main Features

- **Swagger 2.0 & OpenAPI 3.x Support**: Automatically detects and converts both specifications
- **Ready to Use**: Use directly in your browser without any separate installation or configuration
- **Real-time Conversion**: Instantly generate and copy code from the Swagger/OpenAPI page you are viewing
- **Selective Conversion**: Convert only the endpoints you need, not the entire API
- **Multiple Styles Supported**: Generate HTTP client code for Fetch, Axios, Ky, SuperAgent, etc.
- **Customization**: Freely set naming conventions for function names, interface names, and property names
- **Template System**: Create and save custom templates
- **Code Formatting**: Include comments, generate JSDoc, and choose export style
